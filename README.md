Hi, I’m @angelgonzo and welcome to my page.

I'm pursuing my interest of data analysis by teaching myself all the tools I would need.
Besides that I'm interested in a variety of things from gothic media, to videogames, to learning more about psychology, and linguistics (i majored in this lol).
If you want to talk about the posts I'll make, you can reach me here angelg0832@outlook.com

Thank you for checking out my page, and fear the old blood hunter.
